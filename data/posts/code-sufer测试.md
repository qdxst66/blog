I guess the biggest difference is that I didn't know about imenu-list when I wrote outline-toc! I tried to search the "prior art" before rolling my own, but I didn't come across it. It's more "abstract" than what I had been searching for, I think.

As for differences, I can see a few. In markdown, outline-toc shows the section leaders, i.e. the '###' strings preceding a section. These depth indicators makes it easier (to me) to see where I am in the outline. imenu-list might support this, but it's not immediately apparent how to do it.

Another more important difference is that outline-toc synchronizes its position with the master document. As I move around in the master document, outline-toc highlights which section I'm in. Again, imenu-list doesn't seem to do that.
